Load order status              : included |  excluded   | none-existent or with '_' prefix
Load order behaviour           : included | ipatch only | N/A
FPSBooster .excluded behaviour : excluded |  excluded   | included

translation:
lets assume FPSBooster has '.excluded' file.
if LoadOrder exists and does not have .excluded file:
  LoadOrder.ipatch is included (ipatch executed and mod is loaded)
  FPSBooster is excluded 
if LoadOrder has '.excluded' file:
  LoadOrder.ipatch is executed (which prevents LoadOrderMod from loading)
  FPSBooster is excluded (ipatches are not executed and mod is not loaded).
if LoadOrder Does not exist (unsubbed):
  FPSBooster is included (ipatches are executed and mod is loaded)

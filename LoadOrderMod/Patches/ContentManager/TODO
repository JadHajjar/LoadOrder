    time out is 5sec. it should depend on number of remaining assets.
    recovery from failed is performed only once: it should be done in a loop porportional to log2(asset-count)
    wait loop should be more clever than simply to wait idly by forever.
        maybe it should be part of different levels of recovery based on ItemStatus
        maybe it should recount installed items.
        list missing assets.
        check if item was download properly (up to date/right size/...)
        public enum ItemStatus
        {
	        DetailsPending,
	        DetailsReceived,
	        Installed
        }


no assets mode

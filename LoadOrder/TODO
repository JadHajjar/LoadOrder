Caveat:
    - it takes a long time to load game with LOM.
        - is it searching for mods?. maybe create hashtable?
        - is it checking included/excluded mods?


bug:
    - run debug (F5) tool to eliminate access from other threads (replace with invoke).

- LHT command lines
- display WS item download status in tool
- IMT like supports tab (including log file option)

bugs:
    - if I build a new mod, and then press reload in tool, the enable is not always accurate.

- manage DLC's
- profile to manage prefab skipping file.

- property display
- group items
- tool-bar
- status bar


- auto-publish using DefaultTargets https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12165715/call-publish-after-build-in-msbuild

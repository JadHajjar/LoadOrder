to get local last updated time:
	ISteamUGC.GetItemInstallInfo
	ISteamUGC.GetItemState( PublishedFileId_t nPublishedFileID );

profiling in game sub/unsub disable/enable
mass enabling mods will trigger the following for every mod enabled:
	PluginManager.eventPluginsStateChanged
	UserMod.OnSettingsUI()
mass disabling mods will do the above but also additionally
	gets ugc details for all mods/assets two times

TriggerEventPluginsChanged checks PluginManager.m_EventsEnabled == 0 to avoid triggering events.
	so m_EventsEnabled++ can be used to prevent calling OnSettingsUI too many times.
